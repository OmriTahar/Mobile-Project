# Trigger-Finger

As a second year Game Dev student,  we were instructed to make for our Unity course - final project:

"2-3 minutes of content, of a playable and hopefully enjoyable - mobile game."

And after 40 hours of blood, sweat and aching tuchus, I am proud to present the final product! 

 - TRIGGER FINGER -

An FPS puzzle maze where you advance your way by finding and shooting all targets in a section.  

With limited ammo and no crosshair, you will have to use your mighty brain in order to finish the last section of the demo.
